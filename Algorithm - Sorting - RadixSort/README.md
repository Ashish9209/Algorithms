The provided code implements the Radix Sort algorithm, which is a non-comparative sorting algorithm that sorts numbers by processing individual digits. Here’s a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:

### Radix Sort Overview

Radix Sort works by sorting the input list of numbers based on individual digits, starting from the least significant digit (LSD) to the most significant digit (MSD). It uses a stable sorting algorithm, like Counting Sort, as a subroutine to sort the digits.

### Code Breakdown

#### 1. `radix_sort` Function

```python
def radix_sort(to_be_sorted):
  maximum_value = max(to_be_sorted)
  max_exponent = len(str(maximum_value))
  being_sorted = to_be_sorted[:]

  for exponent in range(max_exponent):
    position = exponent + 1
    index = -position

    digits = [[] for i in range(10)]

    for number in being_sorted:
      number_as_a_string = str(number)
      try:
        digit = number_as_a_string[index]
      except IndexError:
        digit = 0
      digit = int(digit)

      digits[digit].append(number)

    being_sorted = []
    for numeral in digits:
      being_sorted.extend(numeral)

  return being_sorted
```

- **Find Maximum Value**:
  ```python
  maximum_value = max(to_be_sorted)
  ```
  - Determines the maximum value in the list to figure out the number of digits in the largest number.

- **Calculate Maximum Exponent**:
  ```python
  max_exponent = len(str(maximum_value))
  ```
  - Converts the maximum value to a string to determine the number of digits (exponents) required to sort.

- **Initialization**:
  ```python
  being_sorted = to_be_sorted[:]
  ```
  - Creates a copy of the input list to perform sorting without modifying the original list.

- **Iterate Over Each Digit Position**:
  ```python
  for exponent in range(max_exponent):
    position = exponent + 1
    index = -position
  ```
  - Loops through each digit position from the least significant digit to the most significant digit.

- **Initialize Buckets**:
  ```python
  digits = [[] for i in range(10)]
  ```
  - Creates 10 empty lists (buckets) to hold numbers based on their digit value (0 through 9).

- **Distribute Numbers into Buckets**:
  ```python
  for number in being_sorted:
    number_as_a_string = str(number)
    try:
      digit = number_as_a_string[index]
    except IndexError:
      digit = 0
    digit = int(digit)
    digits[digit].append(number)
  ```
  - Converts each number to a string and extracts the digit at the current position.
  - If the position is out of range (e.g., the number has fewer digits than the current position), it defaults to `0`.
  - Appends the number to the corresponding bucket based on its digit value.

- **Concatenate Buckets**:
  ```python
  being_sorted = []
  for numeral in digits:
    being_sorted.extend(numeral)
  ```
  - Flattens the buckets and combines them into a single list, which becomes the new `being_sorted` for the next iteration.

- **Return Sorted List**:
  ```python
  return being_sorted
  ```
  - After processing all digit positions, the fully sorted list is returned.

#### 2. Example Usage

```python
unsorted_list = [830, 921, 163, 373, 961, 559, 89, 199, 535, 959, 40, 641, 355, 689, 621, 183, 182, 524, 1]
print(radix_sort(unsorted_list))
```

- **Initialization**:
  - `unsorted_list` is a list of integers to be sorted.

- **Sort and Print**:
  - Calls `radix_sort` with `unsorted_list` and prints the sorted result.

### Summary

- **Radix Sort**:
  - **Stable Sorting**: Radix Sort is stable and ensures that the order of numbers with the same digit value remains consistent across iterations.
  - **Digit-Based Sorting**: It processes numbers based on individual digits, making it efficient for sorting integers with a fixed number of digits.
  - **Complexity**: Radix Sort has a time complexity of \(O(n \cdot k)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements and \(k\) is the number of digits in the largest number. It’s efficient when \(k\) (number of digits) is small relative to \(n\).

The code provides a straightforward implementation of Radix Sort that uses digit-by-digit sorting to arrange numbers in ascending order.
