The code demonstrates how to build a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT), also known as a Fenwick Tree, from an initial array. The Binary Indexed Tree is a data structure that allows efficient updates and prefix sum queries on an array.

### Key Concepts

1. **Binary Indexed Tree (BIT):**
   - A BIT provides a way to efficiently calculate prefix sums and update elements in an array.
   - It uses a binary representation to manage the cumulative frequencies or sums.

2. **Binary Indexed Tree Structure:**
   - Each element in the BIT stores information about a range of elements in the original array.
   - The update and query operations take advantage of binary operations to efficiently traverse the tree structure.

### Explanation of the Code

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. **Initialize Arrays:**
   ```python
   arr = [1, 8, -13, 4, 7, -6, 12, 14, 2, -8, 16, 3]
   binary_indexed_tree = [1, 8, -13, 4, 7, -6, 12, 14, 2, -8, 16, 3]
   ```
   - `arr` is the initial array with elements.
   - `binary_indexed_tree` is initialized to the same values as `arr`.

2. **Update the BIT:**
   ```python
   i = 1
   nxt = i + (i & -1)
   binary_indexed_tree[nxt - 1] += binary_indexed_tree[i - 1]
   ```
   - The code starts with `i = 1`, and calculates the next index `nxt` to update using the formula `nxt = i + (i & -i)`.
   - `i & -i` gives the least significant bit of `i`, which helps determine the range of indices affected by the update.
   - `nxt - 1` adjusts the index for zero-based indexing in `binary_indexed_tree`.
   - The element at the `nxt - 1` index is updated by adding the value of the current index `i - 1`.

3. **Update the BIT for Subsequent Elements:**
   ```python
   for i in range(2, len(binary_indexed_tree)):
       nxt = i + (i & -i)
       if nxt - 1 >= len(binary_indexed_tree):
           continue
       binary_indexed_tree[nxt - 1] += binary_indexed_tree[i - 1]
   ```
   - This loop iterates through indices starting from 2 up to the length of the `binary_indexed_tree`.
   - For each index `i`, it calculates the next index `nxt` for the update.
   - If `nxt - 1` is out of bounds, the loop continues to the next iteration.
   - Otherwise, it updates `binary_indexed_tree[nxt - 1]` by adding the value at `binary_indexed_tree[i - 1]`.

4. **Print the Result:**
   ```python
   print(binary_indexed_tree)
   ```
   - Finally, the code prints the updated `binary_indexed_tree`.

### Understanding the Binary Indexed Tree Update

The Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) is designed to efficiently handle updates and prefix sum queries. The updates are performed using binary operations to adjust the values in the tree structure. Each node in the BIT represents a range of elements in the original array, and the structure is built to efficiently support cumulative frequency calculations.

### Example of BIT Update

If you start with `binary_indexed_tree` initialized to the values of `arr`, after performing the update operations, the BIT will store cumulative sums in such a way that:

- Each index in `binary_indexed_tree` contains the sum of a range of elements from the original array.
- For instance, if you update the value at index 1, this update propagates to the relevant indices in the BIT to ensure all necessary cumulative sums are updated.

By the end of the code execution, the `binary_indexed_tree` will represent the cumulative sums up to each index, adjusted for the range covered by each node.
