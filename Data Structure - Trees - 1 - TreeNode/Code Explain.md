This Python code defines a simple tree data structure using a `TreeNode` class, and then demonstrates its usage by creating a small organizational hierarchy. Here’s a breakdown of the code:

### `TreeNode` Class

1. **Class Definition:**
   ```python
   class TreeNode:
   ```
   This defines a class named `TreeNode` which represents a node in a tree structure.

2. **Constructor (`__init__` Method):**
   ```python
   def __init__(self, value):
       self.value = value
       self.children = []
   ```
   The constructor initializes a node with:
   - `value`: The data stored in the node.
   - `children`: A list that will hold the node’s child nodes.

3. **Add Child Method (`add_child`):**
   ```python
   def add_child(self, child_node):
       print("Adding " + child_node.value)
       self.children.append(child_node)
   ```
   This method adds a `child_node` to the current node’s `children` list and prints a message indicating the addition.

4. **Remove Child Method (`remove_child`):**
   ```python
   def remove_child(self, child_node):
       print("Removing " + child_node.value + " from " + self.value)
       self.children = [child for child in self.children if child is not child_node]
   ```
   This method removes a specified `child_node` from the current node’s `children` list and prints a message indicating the removal.

5. **Traverse Method (`traverse`):**
   ```python
   def traverse(self):
       print("Traversing...")
       nodes_to_visit = [self]
       while len(nodes_to_visit) > 0:
           #nodes_to_visit.pop()
           current_node = nodes_to_visit.pop()
           print(current_node.value)
           nodes_to_visit+=(current_node.children)
   ```
   This method performs a breadth-first traversal of the tree:
   - It starts by printing "Traversing..." and initializing `nodes_to_visit` with the root node (`self`).
   - It enters a loop that continues as long as there are nodes in `nodes_to_visit`.
   - It pops a node from `nodes_to_visit`, prints its value, and adds its children to `nodes_to_visit` to visit them in subsequent iterations.

### Example Usage

1. **Create Nodes:**
   ```python
   root = TreeNode("CEO")
   first_child = TreeNode("Vice-President")
   second_child = TreeNode("Head of Marketing")
   third_child = TreeNode("Marketing Assistant")
   ```
   Creates instances of `TreeNode` for each role in the organization.

2. **Build Tree Structure:**
   ```python
   root.add_child(first_child)
   root.add_child(second_child)
   second_child.add_child(third_child)
   ```
   - `root` (CEO) has two children: `first_child` (Vice-President) and `second_child` (Head of Marketing).
   - `second_child` (Head of Marketing) has one child: `third_child` (Marketing Assistant).

3. **Traverse Tree:**
   ```python
   root.traverse()
   ```
   This call performs a breadth-first traversal starting from the root (CEO) and prints the values of the nodes in the order they are visited.

### Output

When you run the code, the following will be printed:
```
Adding Vice-President
Adding Head of Marketing
Adding Marketing Assistant
Traversing...
CEO
Vice-President
Head of Marketing
Marketing Assistant
```
This output shows the hierarchy and the order in which nodes are visited during the traversal.

**Notes:**
- The `nodes_to_visit.pop()` line is commented out, which affects the traversal order. When uncommented, it changes the traversal to depth-first. As is, it performs breadth-first traversal.
- The `remove_child` method is defined but not used in this example. It would be used to remove a child node from the current node's list of children.
