Break down the code for this **Trie** data structure, which is a type of search tree used for storing strings. 

### Classes

#### `TrieNode` Class

**Purpose:** Represents a single node in the Trie.

- **Attributes:**
  - `nodes`: A dictionary where each key is a character and each value is a `TrieNode` that follows that character.
  - `end_of_key`: A boolean that indicates whether the node represents the end of a complete string.
  - `freq`: An integer that keeps track of how many times strings that pass through this node have been added.

- **Methods:**
  - `add_char(c: chr)`: 
    - Checks if the character `c` is already a child node of the current node.
    - If not, creates a new `TrieNode` for the character and adds it to the `nodes` dictionary.
    - Returns the `TrieNode` corresponding to the character `c`.

#### `Trie` Class

**Purpose:** Manages the Trie operations and provides methods for string management and queries.

- **Attributes:**
  - `root`: The root node of the Trie, which is an instance of `TrieNode`.

- **Methods:**
  - `__init__()`: Initializes the Trie with a root node.

  - `add_string(word: str) -> None`:
    - Starts at the root node (`nxt`).
    - For each character `i` in the string `word`, it:
      - Uses `add_char(i)` to navigate through or create new nodes in the Trie.
      - Updates the `freq` attribute of each node along the path (increases the count to show that this string has passed through this node).
    - After processing all characters, it sets `end_of_key` to `True` on the final node to mark the end of the string.

  - `search_string(string: str) -> bool`:
    - Starts at the root node (`nxt2`).
    - For each character `i` in the string `string`, it:
      - Checks if `i` exists as a child of the current node.
      - If not, returns `False` (the string is not present in the Trie).
      - If the character exists, moves to the corresponding child node.
    - After processing all characters, it checks if the last node has `end_of_key` set to `True` to determine if it represents the end of a complete string. Returns `True` if it does, otherwise `False`.

  - `count_prefix(prefix: str) -> int`:
    - Starts at the root node (`nxt`).
    - For each character `i` in the string `prefix`, it:
      - Checks if `i` exists as a child of the current node.
      - If not, returns `0` (no strings with this prefix).
      - If the character exists, moves to the corresponding child node.
    - After processing all characters, it returns the `freq` of the final node, which indicates how many strings in the Trie have this prefix.

### Summary

- **`TrieNode`**: Represents each node in the Trie. It stores children nodes, whether it marks the end of a string, and the frequency of strings passing through it.
- **`Trie`**: Manages operations for adding strings, searching for strings, and counting how many strings start with a given prefix.

This Trie implementation is efficient for operations like searching, inserting, and prefix counting, especially useful for tasks involving large sets of strings or autocomplete features.
