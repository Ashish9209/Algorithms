Here's an explanation of the `Graph` class and its methods in the provided code:

```python
class Graph:
  def __init__(self, directed=False):
    self.graph_dict = {}
    self.directed = directed
```

### `__init__(self, directed=False)`

- **Purpose**: Initializes a new graph.
- **Parameters**:
  - `directed` (default `False`): A boolean that determines if the graph is directed or undirected. In a directed graph, edges have a direction, while in an undirected graph, edges do not.
- **Attributes**:
  - `self.graph_dict`: A dictionary where each key is a vertex value, and each value is a `Vertex` object.
  - `self.directed`: Stores whether the graph is directed or not.

```python
  def add_vertex(self, vertex):
    self.graph_dict[vertex.value] = vertex
```

### `add_vertex(self, vertex)`

- **Purpose**: Adds a vertex to the graph.
- **Parameters**:
  - `vertex`: An instance of the `Vertex` class, which represents the vertex to be added.
- **Functionality**:
  - The vertex is added to `self.graph_dict` with the vertex's value as the key and the vertex object as the value.

```python
  def add_edge(self, from_vertex, to_vertex, weight=0):
    self.graph_dict[from_vertex.value].add_edge(to_vertex.value, weight)
    if not self.directed:
      self.graph_dict[to_vertex.value].add_edge(from_vertex.value, weight)
```

### `add_edge(self, from_vertex, to_vertex, weight=0)`

- **Purpose**: Adds an edge between two vertices in the graph.
- **Parameters**:
  - `from_vertex`: The starting vertex of the edge (an instance of `Vertex`).
  - `to_vertex`: The ending vertex of the edge (an instance of `Vertex`).
  - `weight` (default `0`): The weight of the edge, representing the cost or distance.
- **Functionality**:
  - Adds an edge from `from_vertex` to `to_vertex` with the specified weight.
  - If the graph is undirected, it also adds an edge from `to_vertex` to `from_vertex` with the same weight.

```python
  def find_path(self, start_vertex, end_vertex):
    start = [start_vertex]
    seen = {}
    while len(start) > 0:
      current_vertex = start.pop(0)
      seen[current_vertex] = True
      print("Visiting " + current_vertex)
      if current_vertex == end_vertex:
        return True
      else:
        vertex = self.graph_dict[current_vertex]
        next_vertices = vertex.get_edges()
        
        # Filter next_vertices so it only
        # includes vertices NOT IN seen
        
        # Checkpoint 3, uncomment and replace the question marks:
        next_vertices = [vertex for vertex in next_vertices if vertex not in seen]
        start.extend(next_vertices)
        
    return False
```

### `find_path(self, start_vertex, end_vertex)`

- **Purpose**: Finds whether there is a path from `start_vertex` to `end_vertex`.
- **Parameters**:
  - `start_vertex`: The starting vertex of the path search.
  - `end_vertex`: The destination vertex of the path search.
- **Functionality**:
  - Uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to explore the graph.
  - Initializes a queue `start` with the `start_vertex` and a dictionary `seen` to keep track of visited vertices.
  - Continuously removes a vertex from the front of the queue (`current_vertex`), marks it as seen, and prints it.
  - Checks if `current_vertex` is the `end_vertex`. If so, returns `True` to indicate that a path exists.
  - If not, retrieves the list of adjacent vertices from the `current_vertex` using `vertex.get_edges()`.
  - **Checkpoint**: Filters `next_vertices` to exclude any vertices that have already been seen to avoid revisiting them.
  - Adds the filtered vertices to the `start` queue for further exploration.
  - If the queue is exhausted and no path is found, returns `False`.

### Summary

- **Graph Initialization**: The `Graph` class is initialized with a choice of directed or undirected edges.
- **Vertex Addition**: Vertices are added to the graph's dictionary.
- **Edge Addition**: Edges are added between vertices, with support for both directed and undirected graphs.
- **Path Finding**: Uses BFS to search for a path between two vertices, marking vertices as seen to avoid cycles and unnecessary work.

This code relies on the `Vertex` class having methods like `add_edge()` and `get_edges()`, which manage the edges and adjacency information for each vertex. If these methods are not implemented correctly, or if `Vertex` is not properly defined, the `Graph` class will not function as expected.
