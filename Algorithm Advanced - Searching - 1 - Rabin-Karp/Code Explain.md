### 1. `polynomial_hash(s)` Function

```python
def polynomial_hash(s):
    hash_value = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        hash_value += (ord(s[i]) * (26 ** (len(s) - i - 1)))
    return hash_value
```

- **Purpose:** This function calculates a hash value for a string `s` using a polynomial hashing method.
- **How it works:**
  - `hash_value` starts at 0.
  - For each character `s[i]` in the string:
    - `ord(s[i])` gets the ASCII value of the character.
    - `(26 ** (len(s) - i - 1))` calculates the weight of the character based on its position in the string (from the most significant position to the least significant position).
    - The product of the ASCII value and the weight is added to `hash_value`.
  - Finally, it returns the computed `hash_value`.

**Example:** For the string "ABC" with ASCII values `ord('A') = 65`, `ord('B') = 66`, and `ord('C') = 67`, the hash is computed as:
- `65 * (26^2) + 66 * (26^1) + 67 * (26^0)`

### 2. `polynomial_rolling_hash(s, H, c)` Function

```python
def polynomial_rolling_hash(s, H, c):
    return (H - ord(s[0]) * 26 ** (len(s) - 1)) * 26 + ord(c)
```

- **Purpose:** This function updates the hash value when rolling the window over the text. It removes the effect of the first character and adds the effect of a new character.
- **How it works:**
  - `H` is the current hash value of the substring.
  - `ord(s[0]) * 26 ** (len(s) - 1)` computes the hash contribution of the character that is being removed from the start.
  - Subtracting this from `H` removes the old character’s hash contribution.
  - Multiplying by 26 shifts the hash value to the left by one position (accounting for the new character’s weight).
  - Adding `ord(c)` includes the new character's hash contribution.

### 3. `rabin_karp_algorithm(pattern, text)` Function

```python
def rabin_karp_algorithm(pattern, text):
    pattern_length = len(pattern)
    text_length = len(text)
    occurrences = 0
    substring = text[:pattern_length]
    substring_hash = polynomial_hash(substring)
    pattern_hash = polynomial_hash(pattern)
    
    if pattern_hash == substring_hash:
        occurrences += 1
    
    for c in text[pattern_length:]:
        substring_hash = polynomial_rolling_hash(substring, substring_hash, c)
        substring = substring[1:] + c
        if pattern_hash == substring_hash:
            occurrences += 1
    
    return occurrences
```

- **Purpose:** This function searches for occurrences of `pattern` in `text` using the Rabin-Karp algorithm.
- **How it works:**
  - `pattern_length` and `text_length` store the lengths of the pattern and text.
  - `occurrences` is a counter for how many times the pattern is found in the text.
  - The initial substring of `text` with length equal to `pattern_length` is hashed.
  - The hash of the `pattern` is calculated.
  - The function first checks if the hash of the initial substring matches the hash of the pattern. If it matches, it increments `occurrences`.
  - It then iterates through the rest of the `text`:
    - Updates the hash of the current substring using `polynomial_rolling_hash`.
    - Adjusts the substring by removing the old character from the start and adding the new character at the end.
    - Compares the updated hash with the pattern hash. If they match, it increments `occurrences`.
  - Finally, the function returns the number of occurrences.

### 4. Test Case

```python
pattern = 1000 * 'A'
text = 1000000 * 'A'
print(rabin_karp_algorithm(pattern, text))
```

- **Purpose:** This test case checks the performance of the Rabin-Karp algorithm with very large strings.
- **What it does:**
  - `pattern` is a string of 1000 'A's.
  - `text` is a string of 1,000,000 'A's.
  - It calls `rabin_karp_algorithm` to find how many times the `pattern` occurs in the `text`.
  - Given that the text consists of repeating 'A's, the pattern will occur multiple times, and the function prints the total count.
