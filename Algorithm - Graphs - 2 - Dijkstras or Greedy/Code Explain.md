This Python code implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a start node to all other nodes in a weighted graph. Here's a detailed explanation of each part of the code:

### Imports

```python
from heapq import heappop, heappush
from math import inf
```

- **`heapq`**: Provides functions for heap queue (priority queue) operations.
  - **`heappop`**: Pops the smallest item from the heap.
  - **`heappush`**: Pushes an item onto the heap.
- **`math.inf`**: Represents positive infinity, used here to initialize distances to a large value.

### Graph Definition

```python
graph = {
    'A': [('B', 10), ('C', 3)],
    'C': [('D', 2)],
    'D': [('E', 10)],
    'E': [('A', 7)],
    'B': [('C', 3), ('D', 2)]
}
```

- The graph is represented as an adjacency list where each key is a vertex, and its value is a list of tuples. Each tuple represents a neighboring vertex and the weight of the edge connecting them.

### Dijkstra's Algorithm Function

```python
def dijkstras(graph, start):
    distances = {}
    
    for vertex in graph:
        distances[vertex] = inf
    
    distances[start] = 0
    vertices_to_explore = [(0, start)]
    
    while vertices_to_explore:
        current_distance, current_vertex = heappop(vertices_to_explore)
        
        for neighbor, edge_weight in graph[current_vertex]:
            new_distance = current_distance + edge_weight
            
            if new_distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = new_distance
                heappush(vertices_to_explore, (new_distance, neighbor))
                
    return distances
```

- **Initialize Distances:**
  ```python
  distances = {}
  for vertex in graph:
      distances[vertex] = inf
  ```
  Sets the initial distance for each vertex to infinity (`inf`), except for the start vertex.

- **Set Start Vertex Distance:**
  ```python
  distances[start] = 0
  vertices_to_explore = [(0, start)]
  ```
  Initializes the distance to the start vertex as 0 and puts it into the priority queue (`vertices_to_explore`), which is implemented as a min-heap.

- **Main Loop:**
  ```python
  while vertices_to_explore:
      current_distance, current_vertex = heappop(vertices_to_explore)
  ```
  Pops the vertex with the smallest distance from the priority queue.

- **Update Distances:**
  ```python
  for neighbor, edge_weight in graph[current_vertex]:
      new_distance = current_distance + edge_weight
      if new_distance < distances[neighbor]:
          distances[neighbor] = new_distance
          heappush(vertices_to_explore, (new_distance, neighbor))
  ```
  Iterates over the neighbors of the current vertex. Calculates the potential new distance to each neighbor. If this new distance is smaller than the known distance, it updates the distance and pushes the neighbor into the priority queue.

- **Return Distances:**
  ```python
  return distances
  ```

  Returns a dictionary of the shortest distances from the start vertex to all other vertices.

### Running the Algorithm and Printing Results

```python
distances_from_d = dijkstras(graph, 'D')
print("\n\nShortest Distances: {0}".format(distances_from_d))
```

- **Compute Shortest Distances:**
  ```python
  distances_from_d = dijkstras(graph, 'D')
  ```
  Executes Dijkstra's algorithm with 'D' as the starting vertex.

- **Print Results:**
  ```python
  print("\n\nShortest Distances: {0}".format(distances_from_d))
  ```
  Prints the computed shortest distances from vertex 'D' to all other vertices.

### Example Output

Given the graph, the shortest distances from vertex 'D' would be calculated and printed. For instance, if you run the code, you might get output similar to:

```
Shortest Distances: {'A': 17, 'B': 2, 'C': 5, 'D': 0, 'E': 10}
```

This indicates that the shortest path from 'D' to:
- 'A' is 17
- 'B' is 2
- 'C' is 5
- 'D' itself is 0
- 'E' is 10
