# Understanding Graphs in Computer Science

Graphs are a fundamental data structure used to model networks and relationships between entities. Below are some essential terms and concepts related to graphs:

## Key Terms

### 1. Vertex
- **Definition**: A vertex (or node) is a fundamental unit in a graph that represents an entity or point.
- **Example**: In a social network, each person can be represented as a vertex.

### 2. Edge
- **Definition**: An edge is a connection between two vertices. It represents a relationship or link between the entities.
- **Example**: In a social network, an edge might represent a friendship between two people.

### 3. Adjacent
- **Definition**: Two vertices are considered adjacent if there is an edge connecting them.
- **Example**: If vertex A and vertex B have an edge between them, they are adjacent.

### 4. Path
- **Definition**: A path is a sequence of one or more edges that connect a sequence of vertices.
- **Example**: A path from vertex A to vertex D could be A → B → C → D.

### 5. Disconnected
- **Definition**: A graph is disconnected if there is at least one pair of vertices that do not have a path connecting them.
- **Example**: In a graph representing a network of cities, a disconnected graph might represent cities that are isolated and cannot be reached from one another.

### 6. Weighted
- **Definition**: A weighted graph assigns a cost or weight to each edge, representing the cost of moving from one vertex to another.
- **Example**: In a transportation network, the weight might represent the distance or time between two locations.

### 7. Directed
- **Definition**: A directed graph (or digraph) has edges with a specified direction, indicating a one-way relationship between vertices.
- **Example**: In a one-way street map, each edge would have a direction indicating the allowed direction of travel.

### 8. Cycle
- **Definition**: A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex and does not repeat any edge.
- **Example**: In a circuit diagram, a cycle might represent a closed loop of connections.

### 9. Adjacency Matrix
- **Definition**: An adjacency matrix is a square matrix used to represent a graph. The rows and columns represent vertices, and each cell indicates whether an edge exists between the corresponding vertices.
- **Example**: In a graph with vertices A, B, and C, the adjacency matrix might look like:
