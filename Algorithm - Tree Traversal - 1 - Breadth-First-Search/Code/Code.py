# Before starting the search, define the treeâ€™s root node as well as a value to search for.
# Initialize a frontier queue, which holds a path for each node to search
# Loop through the frontier queue to check if the node value matches the value we are searching for.
# Continue the search by adding child nodes to the frontier until the goal has been found, or the tree has been completely searched.
