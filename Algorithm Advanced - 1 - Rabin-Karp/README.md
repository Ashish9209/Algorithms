Break down the code and understand its functionality step by step:

### Code Overview

This code implements the Rabin-Karp algorithm, a string-searching algorithm that uses hashing to find occurrences of a pattern within a text. 

### Function: `polynomial_hash(s)`

This function computes a polynomial hash value for the input string `s`. 

#### Explanation:
- **Polynomial Hashing**: This is a technique to compute a hash value based on the characters of the string. Here, the base value is 26 (often used in cases where characters are from the alphabet).
- `ord(s[i])` converts the `i`-th character of the string `s` to its ASCII value.
- The formula `(ord(s[i]) * (26 ** (len(s) - i - 1)))` computes a part of the hash value where each character's contribution is weighted by its position in the string.

### Function: `polynomial_rolling_hash(s, H, c)`

This function computes the rolling hash for the next window in the text after sliding the window one position to the right.

#### Explanation:
- `H` is the hash of the current window.
- `s[0]` is the character that's being removed from the window.
- `c` is the new character being added to the window.
- The hash value is updated by:
  - Removing the contribution of the old character (scaled by `26` to shift left by one character position).
  - Adding the new character's contribution.

### Function: `rabin_karp_algorithm(pattern, text)`

This function uses the Rabin-Karp algorithm to count occurrences of `pattern` in `text`.

#### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: It first computes the hash values for the `pattern` and the initial substring of the `text` with the same length as the `pattern`.
- **Initial Check**: It compares the hash values of the `pattern` and the initial substring to see if there is an immediate match.
- **Rolling Hash**: It then slides the window one character at a time over the `text`, updating the hash value using `polynomial_rolling_hash` and checking for matches with the `pattern` hash.

### Test Case

```python
pattern = 1000*'A'
text = 1000000*'A'
print(rabin_karp_algorithm(pattern, text))
```

- **Pattern**: A string of 1000 `'A'` characters.
- **Text**: A string of 1,000,000 `'A'` characters.
- **Output**: The function `rabin_karp_algorithm` will print the number of times `pattern` appears in `text`.

### Expected Behavior

Since `pattern` is a substring that occurs multiple times in `text`, and given that all characters in `pattern` and `text` are the same, `rabin_karp_algorithm` should count how many times the pattern (which is exactly 1000 characters long) appears within the 1,000,000 characters of the text.

### Efficiency

The Rabin-Karp algorithm is efficient for this type of search, especially when dealing with large texts, because the rolling hash technique avoids recalculating the hash from scratch for every window, leading to an average time complexity of \( O(n + m) \), where \( n \) is the length of the text and \( m \) is the length of the pattern.

In the provided test case, since `pattern` will appear numerous times in `text`, the output will be a very large number, indicating the high efficiency of the algorithm for this kind of input.
