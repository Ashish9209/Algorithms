Break down the code that builds a binary search tree (BST) from a sorted list:

### Code Explanation

1. **Function Definition:**
   ```python
   def build_bst(my_list):
   ```
   This function takes a sorted list (`my_list`) as input and returns a binary search tree.

2. **Base Case Check:**
   ```python
   if len(my_list) == 0:
     return "No Child"
   ```
   If the list is empty (`len(my_list) == 0`), the function returns `"No Child"`. This indicates that there are no more nodes to add in this subtree.

3. **Finding the Middle Element:**
   ```python
   middle_idx = len(my_list) // 2 
   middle_value = my_list[middle_idx]
   ```
   To construct the BST, the function selects the middle element of the list as the root node of the current subtree. `middle_idx` calculates the index of the middle element, and `middle_value` retrieves the value at this index.

4. **Debug Print Statements:**
   ```python
   print("Middle index: {0}".format(middle_idx))
   print("Middle value: {0}".format(middle_value))
   ```
   These lines print the index and value of the middle element to help trace the functionâ€™s execution.

5. **Creating the Tree Node:**
   ```python
   tree_node = {"data": middle_value}
   ```
   A dictionary `tree_node` is created to represent the current node of the BST. It has a key `"data"` holding the `middle_value`.

6. **Recursive Calls:**
   ```python
   tree_node["left_child"] = build_bst(my_list[: middle_idx])
   tree_node["right_child"] = build_bst(my_list[middle_idx + 1 :])
   ```
   The function recursively builds the left and right subtrees:
   - `tree_node["left_child"]` is the result of calling `build_bst` with the elements before the middle index (`my_list[: middle_idx]`).
   - `tree_node["right_child"]` is the result of calling `build_bst` with the elements after the middle index (`my_list[middle_idx + 1 :]`).

7. **Return the Tree Node:**
   ```python
   return tree_node
   ```
   The function returns the created `tree_node`, which now has its left and right children set.

### Testing the Function

- **Test Input:**
  ```python
  sorted_list = [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]
  binary_search_tree = build_bst(sorted_list)
  print(binary_search_tree)
  ```
  The sorted list `[12, 13, 14, 15, 16]` is used to test the function. This will build a BST and print it.

### Time Complexity

- The runtime of this function is `"N*logN"`, where `N` is the number of elements in the list. This is because each element is processed once, and the list is split into two halves in each recursive step, leading to a logarithmic number of levels in the recursion tree.

In summary, this code builds a balanced binary search tree from a sorted list by recursively selecting the middle element as the root and dividing the list into sublists for the left and right children.
